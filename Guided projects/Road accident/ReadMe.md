# Case Study: Road Accident Dashboard Creation
## Project Overview:
The goal of this project is to create a comprehensive road accident dashboard using the Kaggle sample dataset for the years 2021 and 2022. The primary objective is to gain insights into the total casualties that occurred after accidents, analyze the relationship between casualties and accident severity, and identify the maximum casualties by the type of vehicle involved.

#### a. Problem Statement:
The primary challenges addressed in this project are as follows:

  **_i. Total Casualties after the Accident:_**
        Create a dashboard that provides an overview of the total casualties that occurred after road accidents in the years 2021 and 2022.

  **_ii. Total Casualties & Percentage by Accident Severity and Vehicle Type:_**
        Analyze the total casualties, percentage of total casualties concerning accident severity, and identify the maximum casualties based on the type of vehicle involved in the accidents.

#### b. Secondary Key Performance Indicators (KPI):
In addition to the primary objectives, the dashboard will also focus on secondary KPIs for a more comprehensive analysis:

  **_i. Total Casualties with Respect to Vehicle Type:_**
        Provide insights into the total casualties categorized by different types of vehicles.

  **_ii. Monthly Trends Comparison:_**
        Showcase a comparison of casualties on a monthly basis for the current year (2022) and the previous year (2021) to identify trends and patterns.

  **_iii. Maximum Casualties by Road Type:_**
        Identify the road types with the highest casualties and present them in the dashboard.

  **_iv. Distribution of Total Casualties by Road Surface:_**
        Analyze the distribution of total casualties based on different road surfaces, providing insights into how road conditions contribute to accidents.

  **_v. Relationship between Casualties and Area/Location, Day/Night:_**
        Explore the relationship between casualties and their occurrence in different areas or locations. Additionally, analyze the impact of accidents during the day and night.
